  <h1>Shelli K. Spence</h1>
  <p class="tagline">LinkedIn™ Strategist for Executives | Personal Branding Consultant | Career Insurance Advocate</p>

  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
    Shelli K. Spence is a LinkedIn strategist and personal branding consultant who specializes in helping executives over 50 build strategic visibility before they need it. With more than 25 years as a mortgage operations executive—including roles as Chief Credit Officer and Senior Vice President of Operations—Shelli understands the unique challenges facing senior professionals in today's market.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Based in Reno, Nevada, Shelli teaches mid-to-late career executives how to position themselves for opportunity through her proprietary frameworks: the <strong>Career Insurance System</strong> for executives navigating ageism and career transitions, and <strong>Inbound Leads Made Simple</strong> for entrepreneurs and consultants building client pipelines on LinkedIn.
  </p>

  <h2>Professional Background</h2>
  <p>
    Shelli's deep executive experience spans more than two decades in mortgage operations, credit risk management, and team leadership. Her career includes:
  </p>
  
  <h3>Executive Leadership Experience</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)</strong> – Senior Underwriter, expert-level resource for the Processing and Underwriting Division (2023-2025)</li>
    <li><strong>Provident Lending Group</strong> – Chief Credit Officer, led operations and post-closing departments (2021-2023)</li>
    <li><strong>Doorway Home Loans</strong> – Senior Vice President of Operations, restructured loan manufacturing processes and led underwriting, operations, and post-closing teams (2017-2021)</li>
    <li><strong>Endeavor America Loan Services</strong> – Credit Risk Team Leader, Government Underwriting (2014-2017)</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    Throughout her corporate career, Shelli built a reputation for process improvement, team development, and navigating heavily regulated environments—including building her own LinkedIn presence while employed by a federal agency with strict social media policies.
  </p>

  <h2>Current Work: LinkedIn Strategy & Personal Branding</h2>
  <p>
    In 2024, Shelli launched <strong>Shelli's Socials</strong>, a LinkedIn coaching practice focused on strategic positioning for executives and professionals who refuse to be invisible.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Her approach is grounded in real-world experience: she felt the ground shifting in her own career and started building visibility before she needed it. When layoffs hit her industry, her LinkedIn presence gave her options. Now she teaches others how to do the same.
  </p>

  <h3>Frameworks & Methodologies</h3>
  <p>
    Shelli developed the <strong>Optimize → Attract → Convert</strong> framework, a system that helps professionals transform their LinkedIn profiles into 24/7 career insurance. The framework focuses on three core pillars:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Optimize Your Profile</strong> – Strategic positioning that speaks directly to your ideal audience</li>
    <li><strong>Attract Your People</strong> – Visibility strategies that fit your schedule and style</li>
    <li><strong>Convert Your Opportunities</strong> – Turning profile views into real options (job offers, consulting work, speaking engagements, board seats)</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    She offers both the <strong>Career Insurance System</strong> for executives building strategic visibility and the <strong>Inbound Leads Made Simple</strong> system for entrepreneurs and consultants generating client pipelines.
  </p>

  <h3>Coaching & Services</h3>
  <p>
    Shelli works with clients through:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>1:1 Strategy Intensive</strong> – Focused 60-minute sessions with a detailed 90-day action plan</li>
    <li><strong>Small Group Cohorts</strong> – Eight-week programs (max 6 participants) covering the full framework</li>
    <li><strong>Private Instruction</strong> – Four-session intensive for customized guidance</li>
    <li><strong>Retainer Packages</strong> – Ongoing training, strategy, and support</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Media, Speaking & Recognition</h2>
  <p>
    Shelli has been featured and recognized for her expertise in executive positioning and LinkedIn strategy:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Forbes</strong> – Featured in "10 Entrepreneurs Who Prove Success Has No Expiration Date"</li>
    <li><strong>Mornings in the Lab with Keith Bilous</strong> – Guest speaker on overcoming fear of posting on social media and military experience</li>
    <li><strong>closers.io</strong> – Upcoming appearance (2026)</li>
    <li><strong>Link Up Community</strong> – Prominent member and contributor</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    She publishes <strong>The Brief</strong>, a weekly newsletter on Substack providing tactical LinkedIn strategies for executives over 50, and shares thought leadership on career positioning, ageism in the workplace, and building professional optionality.
  </p>

  <h2>Credentials & Military Service</h2>

    <p><strong>Professional Certifications:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Certified Residential Underwriter (CRU) Level III – Mortgage Banking Association</li>

    </ul>
  </div>

  <h2>Philosophy & Approach</h2>
  <p>
    Shelli's philosophy is direct: <em>Your employer doesn't owe you security; you owe yourself that security.</em>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    She believes that the market gets more biased against senior professionals every year—higher salary, higher benefits, stereotyped as "slower" with new technology. But she also believes that strategic visibility, built before you need it, is the most powerful form of career insurance.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Her approach isn't about becoming an influencer or posting constantly. It's about building a LinkedIn presence that creates options: better job offers, consulting opportunities, speaking engagements, board positions, or simply the leverage to walk away from situations that no longer serve you.
  </p>

  <h2>In Her Own Words</h2>
  <blockquote style="border-left: 4px solid #e7f58b; padding-left: 20px; margin: 30px 0; font-style: italic; color: #004744;">
    "It wasn't that long ago I was sitting exactly where you are: knowing my professional world was changing and wanting to protect myself from those changes. I started building my LinkedIn presence because I could feel the ground shifting. I didn't know where it would take me. I just knew I needed to be more visible. I thought I had time. Then another round of layoffs hit, and suddenly I didn't. But this time? My LinkedIn brand gave me options. Real ones. Now I teach mid-to-late career executives how to build that same optionality."
